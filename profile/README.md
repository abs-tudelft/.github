# Accelerated Big Data Systems Group

The Accelerated Big Data Systems (ABS) group is a research group formerly active at the Delft University of Technology since 1999.

## Research directions
The ABS group performs research into high-performance computing infrastructure to enable the efficient processing of big data problems. A number of research topics are carried out in the group, mainly focused on enabling next generation high performance computer hardware to perform scalable big data analytics, such as addressing the limitations in parallelism on a scalable computational infrastructure. In addition, we work on enabling efficient utilization of computer hardware and enabling easy integration of GPUs and FPGAs into big data frameworks.

Research in the field of accelerated big data analytics is mainly industrially driven to address real-life challenges in the field. One application domain our group focuses on is the field of genomics and personalized medicine. This is becoming a strongly data-driven field due to the abundance of extremely large DNA datasets and the high complexity of the analysis algorithms. This effort has results in a high-tech spinoff called Bluebee active at the intersection of genomic analysis and high performance big data analytics.

## Current projects
This GitHub organization contains various projects formerly or currently developed within the ABS group. Some projects also live in people's individual GitHub spaces.

Projects are either an accelerator/acceleration implementation for some computation task on a certain platform, or a tool. This tooling can be a code-generation tool or debugging tool for designing hardware, or a runtime tool to interface with an accelerator.

## Get in touch
Feel free to get in contact with the authors of any of the repositories by opening an issue on the repository or shooting them a message.
